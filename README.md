Program to calculate score for a diver based on 7 judges 
Problem Statement
Create a class that describes one dive in a competition in the sport of diving.
A dive has a competitor name and a competitor number associated with it. 
The dive also has a degree of difficulty and a score from each of the seven judges.
Each score awarded is between 0 and 10, where each score may be a floating-point value.  
The highest and lowest scores are thrown out and the remaining scores are added together.  
The sum is then multiplied by the degree of difficulty for that dive.  
The degree of difficulty ranges from 1.2 to 3.8 points. 
The total is then multiplied by 0.6 to determine the diver’s score.  
The class must include the appropriate methods to support object oriented programming as well as the following problem specific methods:  
•	Class for diving competition. 
•	Declare Attributes 
•	Initialize using a Constructor
•	Use Methods 
•	Set methods 
•	Get methods 
•	Print data
•	Method for Competitor name and competitor number 
•	The Degree of difficulty is 1.2 – 3.8
•	Score from judges is 0 and 10 double 
•	Take out the highest score 
•	Take out the lowest score 
•	Add the rest 
•	 Multiply the sum by the degree of difficulty 
•	Total is multipled by 0.6 to determine divers score
•	A method name inputValidScore that inputs one valid score for one judge for one diver. 
•	A method named inputAllScores that creates an array to store the scores for all judges for the diver.  This method will fill the array with a valid score from each judge.  
•	A method named inputValidDegreeOfDifficulty that inputs a valid degree of difficulty for the dive.  
•	A method named calculateScore that will calculate the score for the diver based on the scores from all judges and the degree of difficulty.  
•	A method that will input the diver information including the name and the competition number.
•	A method that prints out all attributes in the class.
•	INPUT DIVER INFORMATION as a method no return statement so it is void 

Create a main method that is in a separate class including no attributes and no other methods besides main.  A main method that creates a Dive object, inputs all information about the dive, and then prints out all information for the dive.

•	Input all information basically call the class 
•	Print out all information of the class 


Additional Directions
•	 You must not use any Array class or Array  method included in the Java libraries to solve this problem
•	Console input and output must be used to solve this problem.
•	When you are satisfied that your solution works then use the following input values to run your program to create your output file.


Diver Name			Use your actual name
Diver Number			327
Degree of difficulty		2.7
Judge #1 score			7.5
Judge #2 score			9.5
Judge #3 score			5.7
Judge #4 score			8.25
Judge #5 score			6.72
Judge #6	 score			10.0
Judge #7	 score			3.46

•	Part I.   Program Design
o	Rewrite the problem statement in your own words using short bulleted phrases
o	Create a class skeleton for this problem – show your attribute declarations and appropriate comment descriptions.  Also show comment header blocks for your methods.  You do not include the code for the methods at this point   Note you do not have to include MyUtilityClass and its methods in the design work.
o	Post your completed design work for this problem in Blackboard before class begins on the due date listed in the syllabus.
•	Part II.  Completed Program
o	You must complete all of the code for this program and run the program using the specific input values defined in these instructions to generate an output file.
o	Print out a copy of your output file and also your source code in all classes except for MyUtilityClass to turn in for this homework on the due date listed in the syllabus.
